					<h3>AIFC to kick-start Webinar for Coaches</h3>
					<img src="images/blog2.jpeg" height="500" width="1000"><br>
						
						<br><p>This initiative from AIFC comes in the wake of the current scenario of the Coronavirus pandemic. The country which has been in a lock-down for three weeks already, is expected to be extended. Due to this, all sporting activities amongst others are at a standstill.

The AIFC Webinar is an opportunity for Indian football coaches to continue learning from the comforts of their homes. This will also help them stay connected with fellow-coaches and also brush up their knowledge of the sport.

The webinar comprises of eight modules and it will be held between 15th April to 8th May 2020. Below are the topics under each module:</p>

<p>Talking further on this initiative, AIFF Head of Coach Education, Savio Medeira said,

“Every initiative has got a value. AIFC has come out with a great idea in the form of webinar, which will keep the coaches and the tutors engaged for some time and at the same time get mentally refreshed during this lock-down period. Wish AIFC and all tutors a great time of knowledge sharing.”

This initiative has been lauded by the Instructors/Educators and also AIFC Core Team members. They were addressed and informed as to specialization of their roles through video conference earlier today.</p>
